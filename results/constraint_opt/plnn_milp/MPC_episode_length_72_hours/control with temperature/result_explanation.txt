Results that have no relax prepostion are for the setting where these lines of code were commented:

#model.Params.FeasibilityTol = 0.01  # primal feasibility tolerance
#model.Params.IntFeasTol = 0.01  # integer feasibility tolerance
#model.Params.OptimalityTol = 0.01  # dual feasibility tolerance



Results that have relax preposition are for the setting where code imposing certrain relaxation to mixed-integer linear program is active:
model.Params.FeasibilityTol = 0.01  # primal feasibility tolerance
model.Params.IntFeasTol = 0.01  # integer feasibility tolerance
model.Params.OptimalityTol = 0.01  # dual feasibility tolerance
